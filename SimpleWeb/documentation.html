My game of Memory starts once a player has entered their name, deck set, and the desired difficulty then by pressing the "start game" button.
<br>
<h3> XMLHTTPRequest </h3>
A request for a sample game state can be made if one clicks the "load xml" button. This is more proof of concept than an actual loaded game. One can change certain settings the gameGrid.JSON folder to see the outcomes on the graph.
<br>
<h3> HTML5 Audio </h3>
I have included an audio recording of a royalty free song from <a href = "https://www.purple-planet.com/"> Purple Planet </a>
 I have the audio on loop once start game in clicked, one can mute it using the mute game button if one wishes to not hear it.
<h3> HTML5 Extra Credit: Local Storage </h3>
At the bottom of the screen is the hall of fame, with the highscores of everyone on the local machine. It updates on page refresh and after a new highscore.Included is a button that clears localStorage
and therefore the current highscores on the machine.
