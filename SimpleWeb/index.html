		Concentration is normaly played with a deck of cards. Each deck contains 2 cards that share the same symbol. The deck is shuffled and then each card is placed facedown in a grid, one card per grid square. The game rules are as follows:
		<br>
		<ol>
		<li> Player picks two cards. </li>
		<li> The two cards are revealed. </li>
		<li> If the two cards match symbols, they are left faceup and the player gains a point. </li>
		<li> If the two cards are not matching symbols then they are returned facedown. </li>
		<li> Game repeats until all matches are found or time runs out. </li>
		</ol>
