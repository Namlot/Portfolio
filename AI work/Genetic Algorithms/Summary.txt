Genetic Algorithm work

Goal - find a secret code consisting of 11 randomized characters

Parameters - Submitting a code will return the correctess of the code, how many characters are correct
as well as how many characters are in the correct place.

Process - 

1. Randomness 100 different strings 
2. Check Strings for correctness (fitness function)
3. Trim strings that do not meet minimum fitness criteria
4. cross-pair a number of strings
5. mutate a number of strings
6. repeat process until step 2 yields correct code
