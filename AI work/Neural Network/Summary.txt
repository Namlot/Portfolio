Neural Network

Goal- Teach a neural network to perform bit parity

Parameters - Given training data and a simple function that return if bit parity
is true of false

Process - Submit training data through neural network. Network uses input layer,
hidden layers, and an output layer to output the probability of bit parity. Tweaks 
network weights based on training responses.
